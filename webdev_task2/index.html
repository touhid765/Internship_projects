        <p>Hi! I'm Touhid, a budding web developer.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a third-year Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) student with a passion for technology, problem-solving, and software development. Over the course of my studies, I've built a strong foundation in programming, web development, and software engineering principles. I'm particularly interested in projects that bridge the gap between technical knowledge and real-world applications, ensuring that my work remains relevant and impactful.</p>
        <p>Currently, I'm honing my skills through hands-on projects, such as developing a Pharmacy Management System and working on a web development internship with Futureintern. I enjoy exploring new technologies and finding ways to create efficient, user-friendly applications. I'm enthusiastic about entering the tech industry and contributing to projects that make a difference.</p>

You can add an image at the top where you can introduce yourself; below that, you can add contact information.</p>
